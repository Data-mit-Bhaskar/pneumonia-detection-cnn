# **Pneumonia Detection using CNN**
*A **Semester 1 MSc. Computer Vision & AI** project at **Berlin School of Business & Innovation (BSBI)**, where I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection, achieving **92.31% accuracy**. This project aligns with my professional experience at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I optimized data workflows and reduced errors by **11%**, and my focus on **AI-driven solutions for real-world challenges** like healthcare diagnostics.*

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project leverages **deep learning (CNN)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, addressing a critical healthcare challenge: **early and accurate diagnosis**. Using a dataset of **5,856 X-ray images** (Normal/Pneumonia) from Kaggle, I designed a **4-layer CNN architecture** with data augmentation, class weighting, and learning rate scheduling to achieve **92.31% test accuracy**. The project mirrors my work at **Sakon**, where I automated data processes and improved decision-making through analytics.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **Data Augmentation**: Applied **shear, zoom, and horizontal flip** to improve model generalization—similar to my **ETL optimization** at Sakon.
✅ **Class Weighting**: Addressed **imbalanced data** (more pneumonia cases) using `compute_class_weight`, ensuring fair model performance.
✅ **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Used `ReduceLROnPlateau` to dynamically adjust learning rates, boosting convergence.
✅ **Model Evaluation**: Achieved **92.31% accuracy** with detailed analysis of precision/recall trade-offs, reflecting my **analytical rigor** at Mercedes-Benz.
